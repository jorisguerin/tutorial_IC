# Tutorial on Image Clustering

## Overview
This repository is the accompnying code which goes with my tutorial on Image Clustering (Summer Scool of Computer Science department at Universidade Federal Fluminense).
The slides for this tutorial can be found on my webpage (<https://jorisguerin.github.io/>) under *Teaching* or directly downloaded here: [part 1](https://jorisguerin.github.io/documents/tutoIC1.pdf) | [part 2](https://jorisguerin.github.io/documents/tutoIC2.pdf). 

This tutorial is intended to give the reader a practical understanding about how to use transfer learning to cluster unsupervised sets of images. The reader will go through the basic concepts and algorithms for clustering, understand how to use pretrained deep neural networks and how to combine them using ensemble methods to inmprove the final results. All the code is using python and Keras.

## Content
The supplementary material for these notes can be found on this page. It is structured under two jupyter notebooks which should be self contained and can be run while reading the slides. Each notebook correspound to the slides with the same number.
